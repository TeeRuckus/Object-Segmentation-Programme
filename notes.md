<h2> part one i </h2>
- variance/invariance , against image scaling and image rotations
- SIFT
    - it's not suspectible to scalling, as it extracts the features given
different scalings of the image
    - will output different results if the image is rotated
    - will output the same result if the image is scaled up and down
-Image Histograms
    - I am not too sure at the current moment
-Harris corner detection
